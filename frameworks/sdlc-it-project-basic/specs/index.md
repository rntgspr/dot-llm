_No areas yet. Bootstrap a `specs/<area>/` directory the first time a plan touches it. Each row links to `specs/<area>/index.md` with a one-line description (what the area covers, key dependencies)._

# Specs

A pillar for the **living spec** of the system — what is true right now about product features, platform conventions, integrations, and durable decisions. Authored and refactored by the Lead; deltas are absorbed here on plan close.

## Rules

- **Living state.** The body of each `specs/<area>/index.md` (and its concern files) always reflects the current state of the system. There is no `## History` body section — historical wording lives in `archive/<PLAN-ID>/delta.md`.
- **`deltas:` frontmatter is the canonical reference.** Each spec area lists the plan IDs whose deltas built its current state. Drill into `archive/<PLAN-ID>/` only when you need the verbose change wording.
- **Bootstrap on demand.** A spec area is created the first time a plan declares it in `scope:`. Don't seed empty areas in advance.
- **Concerns split inside an area.** A large area splits into per-concern files (`<area>/<concern>.md`) referenced from the area's `## Files` section. Tasks declare which concerns they touch in their frontmatter `concerns:`.
- **Subareas when needed.** When an area grows beyond a flat concern split, promote a concern into a nested subarea: `specs/<area>/<subarea>/index.md` with its own concerns. Subareas follow the same shape as areas recursively. The parent area's `## Files` lists the subarea directories alongside any flat concern files.
- **Per-component split via `<component>.md`** files appears only when content meaningfully diverges between components. Otherwise the area's `index.md` carries everything.
- **Authoring is the Lead's.** Dev never writes inside `specs/` directly — spec absorption happens during the Lead's archive flow, driven by the Dev's `delta-draft.md`.
- **Each area is a directory** with `index.md` (overview, requirements, decisions, files), any concern files, and optional subarea directories.

## When to use

- A plan declares a path under `specs/` in its `scope:` → load the area's `index.md` and the concerns referenced by the active task.
- A task declares `concerns: [<name>, ...]` → load `specs/<area>/<concern>.md` for each.
- Tracing why a behavior is the way it is → follow the area's `deltas:` list back to the archive entries that built it.
- Bootstrapping a new area when planning work that touches an undocumented part of the system (Lead).

## When NOT to use

- Active work in progress → `plans/<PLAN-ID>/`.
- Pre-plan ideation or open questions → `exploring/<slug>/`.
- Verbose change history → `archive/<PLAN-ID>/delta.md`.
- Mirror of tracker items → `intake/`.
