description: Use this skill whenever the user wants to capture, evolve, promote, or drop an exploration — an idea that isn't a plan yet. Trigger on phrases like "explore <topic>", "let's sketch <idea>", "ideia nova sobre X", "promove essa exploração pra um plano", "drop this exploration", "what's in exploring/?", or any task framed as pre-plan ideation. Skill is sdlc-only (knows the `exploring/` pillar, the `promote → plans/maintenance-<slug>/` path).

# `llm-explore` — capture and evolve `exploring/` entries

Explorations are **transient** — they either mature into a plan or get dropped. This skill carries the bootstrap recipe (kebab-case slug, frontmatter from `exploration.md` template) plus the two terminal exits (promote / drop). For raw file ops use `llm flow` directly.

## Layout (recap from schema)

```
exploring/<slug>/
├── index.md          ← required; frontmatter [status!, summary!, apps!]
└── *.md              ← optional aux (referenced via `aux:` if needed)
```

- `<slug>` is **pure kebab-case** — no `maintenance-` prefix, no tracker key.
- `status:` is one of `idea | considering | promoted | dropped` — but `promoted` and `dropped` are **terminal** (the directory is moved or deleted at that point; that status value mostly serves as a tombstone if you do leave it on disk briefly during a transition).

## Recipe: bootstrap a new exploration

When the user says "explore X" / "let's sketch <idea>" / "ideia nova":

1. **Agree on a slug.** Propose one — short, kebab-case, no prefix (e.g., `auth-redesign`, `unify-error-handling`). Confirm with the user.
2. `llm flow exploring/<slug> create`
3. `llm flow exploring/<slug>/index.md create`
4. Open `templates/exploration.md` (under `.llm/templates/`) and copy its shape into the new file. Frontmatter:
   - `status: idea` (start state) — flip to `considering` later if the user is actively weighing options.
   - `summary: <one-line>` — what's the idea in 8-12 words. Will appear in `exploring/index.md` table.
   - `apps: [...]` — affected components (keys from `meta.apps.values`).
5. Fill the body following the template: `## Idea`, `## Context`, `## Options / sketches`, `## Open questions`, `## Promotion / drop criteria`. Author's voice; free prose.
6. Re-emit `exploring/index.md`'s table to include the new row via `llm tag set exploring/index.md exploring <new body>` — v4 shape: `| [<slug>](<slug>/index.md) | <one-line description of the idea, including apps if relevant> |`.
7. `llm doctor` — orphan check should be clean.

## Recipe: evolve status (idea → considering)

Just edit the frontmatter (`status: idea` → `status: considering`). No move, no other file changes. Re-emit the `exploring/index.md` row isn't required because the table doesn't carry `Status` (lean — only live ideas live here; promoted/dropped exit the dir).

## Recipe: promote an exploration to a plan

When the exploration has matured ("vamos virar isso plano agora"):

1. **Decide the destination key.**
   - If a tracker item now exists for it → `plans/<KEY>/` (tracker-backed plan). Run `llm intake <KEY>` first if `intake/<KEY>/` doesn't exist yet.
   - If still no tracker item → `plans/maintenance-<slug>/` (slug-based plan).
2. **Carry over the body.** The exploration's `## Idea` / `## Options` / `## Open questions` become raw material for the new plan's `## Plan / DAG` and `## Out of scope`. Don't dump verbatim — distill what survived the maturation.
3. **Hand off to `llm-plan`** (the bootstrap-plan skill) to author the new `plans/<PLAN-ID>/index.md` with full frontmatter (`scope`, `status: in-progress`, `summary`, `apps`). The plan skill drives the structure; this skill just makes the source content available.
4. **Remove or archive the exploration:**
   - If the exploration's notes are no longer useful → `llm flow exploring/<slug> remove`.
   - If they're worth preserving alongside the plan → `llm flow exploring/<slug> copy plans/<PLAN-ID>/exploration.md` first, then remove the original dir.
5. Re-emit `exploring/index.md` (row disappears) and `plans/index.md` (new row appears).
6. `llm doctor` — both indexes should be consistent.

## Recipe: drop an exploration

When the idea won't happen:

1. Confirm with the user — "drop is permanent (no archive; only plans flow to archive). Sure?"
2. `llm flow exploring/<slug> remove`
3. Re-emit `exploring/index.md`'s table to remove the row.
4. `llm doctor` — orphan check should be clean.

**Don't migrate explorations to archive/.** Archive holds completed plans only.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Plan authoring** — that's `llm-plan`. This skill hands off the body content; the plan skill structures it.
- **Spec absorption** — explorations never touch `specs/`. Only plans do, via the archive flow (`llm-archive`).
- **Tracker mirror** — if you need to pull a tracker item, use `llm-intake` first; this skill only writes the kebab-case slug path.

## Patterns

| User says | You do |
|---|---|
| "Let's explore <idea>" / "ideia nova" | Bootstrap recipe → propose slug → confirm → create dir + index.md from template → re-emit table |
| "What's in exploring?" | Read `exploring/index.md`; if a row interests, drill into `exploring/<slug>/index.md` |
| "Promote auth-redesign to a plan" | Promote recipe → decide key → hand off to `llm-plan` → remove or carry over the exploration body |
| "Drop the auth-redesign idea" | Confirm with user → `llm flow exploring/auth-redesign remove` → re-emit table |
| "Change status to considering" | Edit frontmatter `status:` only |

Use `llm tag get/set` (CLI, no skill) for the round-trip on `exploring/index.md`; pair with `llm-plan` for the promote handoff and `llm-doctor` to verify post-op.
