# <Campaign title — short, descriptive>

<!-- ===== Slug-based campaigns (no tracker key) ===== -->
<!-- Include Overview + Acceptance Criteria only for slug-based campaigns. Tracker-
     backed campaigns defer them to intake/<KEY>/index.md and do not repeat them. -->

## Overview

What this campaign verifies and why. 1-3 paragraphs.

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

- WHEN <trigger> THE SYSTEM SHALL <observable response>.

<!-- ===== End slug-only sections ===== -->

## Test Strategy

Which levels this campaign covers and **why** — the pyramid rationale. What is verified at `unit` vs `integration` vs `e2e`, and what is deliberately **not** automated (and why). Reference the relevant `standards/` (mocking, data, gates) instead of restating them.

## Cases / DAG

Cases, ordered by the `depends-on` they touch.

| Task | Title | Level | Status | Depends on |
|------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| [T1](t1.md) | Short title | unit | pending | — |
| [T2](t2.md) | Short title | e2e | pending | T1 |

Cases may run in parallel when `depends-on:` is satisfied and their `files:` predictions do not overlap. The Lead verifies before dispatch.

## Scope

The `coverage/<area>` paths this campaign touches. Each is bootstrapped if missing. Name the requirement (`intake/<KEY>`) each area covers — the traceability link.

## Risks / Gaps

- Known coverage gap and why it is acceptable (or the follow-up that closes it).
- A flow that resists automation, and the manual check that compensates.

## Out of scope

- Levels or areas intentionally not addressed by this campaign.
