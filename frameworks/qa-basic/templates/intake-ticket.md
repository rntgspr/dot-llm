# <Tracker ticket title>

## Overview

Local restatement of the ticket — what must be verified and why it matters. Written in English even when the source description is in another language. Refined as understanding sharpens; re-sync from the tracker via the intake sync command when the upstream description changes materially.

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

- WHEN <trigger> THE SYSTEM SHALL <observable response>.
- WHEN <trigger> AND <condition> THE SYSTEM SHALL <observable response>.
- WHILE <state> THE SYSTEM SHALL <observable response>.

Coverage areas for this ticket reference this file (a scenario `relates:` back to this `<KEY>`); they do not repeat these criteria. Re-sync from the tracker when the AC changes.
