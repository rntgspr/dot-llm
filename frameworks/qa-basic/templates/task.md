# T<N> — <case title>

## What to do

The concrete case(s) to author/automate: which area, which scenarios (Given-When-Then), at which level. The test files to create or modify.

## Context

Background not in `coverage/`: the requirement being verified (`intake/<KEY>` acceptance criterion), prior decisions, links to the feature under test.

## Author / Automate

Step-by-step. Which fixtures/factories to use (per `standards/test-data`), what to mock at this level (per `standards/mocking-policy`), the runner command to execute the new tests.

## Verify

How to confirm the tests are meaningful and stable — they fail when the behaviour breaks (mutation/red check), pass when it holds, and are not flaky across repeated runs.

## Done when

- [ ] Scenarios authored at the level(s) in `apps:`, each mapping to an acceptance criterion.
- [ ] Tests pass and are non-flaky (verified across repeated runs).
- [ ] Mocking / data / naming comply with the relevant `standards/`.
