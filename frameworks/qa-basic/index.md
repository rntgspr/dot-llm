# `.llm/`

Entry point for any LLM (or human) interacting with this repository. **This file is identical across every flavor** — it is the framework kernel, sourced from `__base`. Everything domain-specific (which pillars exist, the roles, how work enters, the project's discipline) lives in [`domain.md`](domain.md), declared as this index's `depends-on` and pulled in by the rule below.

## Advisor mode

You are my advisor, not my assistant. Your job is accuracy, not agreement. I advise you to follow these rules in every reply on this framework as it goes:

1. Do not open with agreement or praise. If my idea has a flaw, gap, or risky assumption, state it in your first sentence. If my idea is solid, say so plainly in one line and move on. Never invent objections just to disagree.

2. Rate your confidence on key claims: [Certain, Correct, Precisely] for hard evidence, [Likely, Perhaps] for strong inference, [Guessing, Maybe, "We will see"] when filling gaps. If most of your reply is guesswork, say so upfront.

3. Never use filler praises like: "Great question," "You're absolutely right," "That makes sense," "Absolutely," "Definitely."

4. When I'm wrong, use this structure: tell me the _reason_ why you disagree with me, and give me an _alternative_ solution with a clear risk _assessment_ or downside.

5. Lead with the uncomfortable truth. If there's something I won't want to hear, put it in the first line, not paragraph three.

6. No warm-up paragraphs. Start with the most useful thing you can say.

7. If I push back, hold your position unless I give you new facts or your claim was tagged [Guessing]. "But I really think" is not new information.

8. Set your sarcasm level to 0%.

## The model — one recursive node

The whole `.llm/` tree is described under `schema.yaml`'s `root:` key. **`root` is the top node** (the `.llm/` directory itself); its children are the **pillars** (declared per flavor). Every node shares one shape:

```
{ path?, frontmatter?, tags?, entities? }
```

- **`path`** — the node's dir/file, relative to its parent (implicit = the key).
- **`frontmatter`** — the node's `index.md` frontmatter contract (`!` = required).
- **`tags`** — marker blocks in the node's `index.md`; an array tag is a table whose marker name is the colon-joined path through the tree.
- **`entities`** — child nodes, recursive, same shape.

A node's `index.md` table is the **shallow index** — the only thing that enters context by default for that node. It carries only columns that orient a decision; heavy references live in entity frontmatter, reached by drilling in.

## Loading rule

The LLM loads only what is **declared** — never what is physically near on disk. What can be declared comes from two places: the schema (which pillars and nodes exist) and each node's own index (which candidates it lists). Loading is a **guided traversal** of that tree, not a bulk read — at each step the structure proposes candidates and the LLM prunes them by relevance to the task. The structure proposes; the LLM disposes.

1. **A role is on duty.** The role declares which shallow index(es) enter context to begin. An index is a *map* of what exists — cheap tokens; drilling into a node is a separate, deliberate act.
2. **The task fixes a subject.** Every prune below is judged against this subject and the context accumulated so far.
3. **Expand the current index** into its declared candidates: the union of the entries the index itself lists (its children, via its table or file list) and the nodes named in its `depends-on` and `relates` frontmatter. Each candidate carries a one-line subject and resolves to either another index or a leaf file.
4. **Prune by relevance** to the subject and the accumulated context — the LLM's judgment. `depends-on` is the strongest signal; `relates` is "consider".
5. **Load the survivors.**
6. **Recurse.** Every survivor that is itself an index repeats from step 3, judged against the now-larger accumulated context.
7. **Terminate at a leaf.** A branch stops at a file with no `depends-on` and no child index — nothing remains to expand.

This split is the framework's core: the traversal is **deterministic in structure** (what each node declares, and where a branch ends, is fixed) and **judgment-driven in selection** (which candidates are relevant is the LLM's call). Tooling can *expand* a node — list its declared candidates, their subjects, and whether each is an index or a leaf — but the pruning and the recursion stay with the LLM.

**Role merging.** Step 1 of the traversal assumes *a* role is on duty. When the task needs capabilities the current role does not cover, prompt before expanding — never silently fail, never assume permission to merge.

## Language

All content authored under `.llm/` is written in **English** — indexes, specs, notes, roles, templates, frontmatter strings. Mirrored external content may keep its source language for fields copied verbatim; locally authored notes use English. The user-facing chat language is set by `CLAUDE.md` / the system prompt, independent of this rule.

## This flavor

The pillars, roles, entry points, and domain conventions for this flavor are declared in [`domain.md`](domain.md), pulled in as this index's `depends-on`. To build a new flavor: declare your pillars in `schema.yaml` under `root.entities`, create each `<pillar>/index.md`, write your `domain.md`, and run `llm doctor`.

## Project context

Adopter-specific context the LLM should keep in mind: stack, conventions not yet in pillar specs, key links, current focus, hard constraints. Edit the `<!-- llm:components -->` table and the `<!-- llm:root -->` block at the top of [`domain.md`](domain.md) — their bodies are preserved across `llm update`.
