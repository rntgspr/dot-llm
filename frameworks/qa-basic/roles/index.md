# Roles

Agent role definitions. Each describes responsibilities, restrictions, and the workflow expected of an LLM acting in that capacity.

> This flavor has **no Ghost role**: QA work is deliberate (plan → author cases → run → record), so the sdlc read-only ad-hoc role earns no place here.

## When to use

The user signals the role at the start of a session (e.g. "as Lead, plan coverage for checkout" or "as Dev, automate T2"). The matching role file is loaded then. Outside that signal, role files are not read by default.
