description: Use this skill whenever the user wants to SEE the infrastructure architecture as text — render the topology as a diagram, show what is connected to what, draw the stack/dependency graph, visualize apply order, or map how stacks depend on each other. Trigger on phrases like "draw the architecture", "what's connected where", "show the topology", "diagram the stacks", "render the dependency graph", "diagrama da arquitetura", "o que depende de quê", "como os stacks se conectam". Read-only — it renders the DECLARED topology, it does not change it.

# `llm-arch` — render the infrastructure topology as a text diagram

Turns the `topology/` pillar's **declared** `depends-on` / `relates` edges into a text-mode architecture view: a **Mermaid** graph (renders as a real diagram in GitHub / Obsidian / IDEs) plus an **ASCII** apply-order layering for pure terminals. No new state — this reads the topology and draws it. The graph is only as good as what the topology declares; it never invents connectivity.

## What the edges mean

- A topology area's frontmatter `depends-on:` lists the stacks that must be **provisioned first** — i.e. this stack consumes their outputs. So `A.depends-on = [B]` ⇒ the arrow is **`B --> A`** (B is the prerequisite; outputs/apply-order flow B → A).
- `relates:` is a soft cross-link ("consider") — render it **dashed**.
- `depends-on` must be a **DAG** (it is the apply order). If you detect a cycle, that is a real defect — surface it, don't draw it as if valid.

## Data sources (cheapest first)

1. **`topology/index.md` table** — v4 `[Link, Description]` shape: one row per `topology/<area>/index.md`. The shallow index gives every node; for edges, drill into each area's frontmatter `depends-on:` (apply order) and `relates:` (cross-links).
2. **Drill into `topology/<area>/index.md`** only when the user wants more than the skeleton — the frontmatter `depends-on`/`relates`/`apps` (authoritative over the table if they ever differ) and the `## Interface` section (inputs/outputs) to label *what* flows on an edge.
3. **`runbooks/<slug>/index.md` `relates:`** — only when asked to overlay operations ("show which runbooks touch which stacks").

## Steps

1. Read `topology/index.md`. Build the node set (each area `Path`) and the edge set (`depends-on` = solid, `relates` = dashed). Capture each node's `apps` (environments).
2. If the user asked to scope it (one environment, one subtree, "around stack X"), **prune** to the relevant nodes + their declared neighbours — don't render the whole tree when a slice was asked for.
3. If asked for detail, drill per step 2/3 above to label edges with what flows (from `## Interface`) and/or overlay runbooks.
4. Render **Mermaid** (default `graph TD`, top-down = foundational stacks on top). Then render the **ASCII** apply-order layering. Output both to chat.
5. If `depends-on` has a cycle, or an edge points at a path with no `topology/<area>/`, call it out explicitly under the diagram.

## Mermaid output (template)

````
```mermaid
graph TD
  %% nodes: name[label] — annotate with environments
  networking["networking<br/><small>dev,staging,prod</small>"]
  data["data<br/><small>dev,staging,prod</small>"]
  app["app<br/><small>dev,staging,prod</small>"]
  observability["observability<br/><small>all</small>"]

  %% depends-on (solid): prerequisite --> dependent (= apply order)
  networking --> data
  networking --> app
  data --> app

  %% relates (dashed): soft cross-link
  app -.-> observability
```
````

When environments matter, you may group with `subgraph dev` / `subgraph prod`, or add `classDef` colours — but only if it aids reading; default to env badges in the node label.

## ASCII output (apply-order layering)

A topological layering — stacks with no `depends-on` first, each later layer depending only on earlier ones. This reads as "provision top-to-bottom":

```
Layer 0 (no prerequisites):
  • networking            [dev,staging,prod]

Layer 1 (depends on Layer 0):
  • data        ← networking          [dev,staging,prod]

Layer 2 (depends on ≤ Layer 1):
  • app         ← networking, data    [dev,staging,prod]
        ┄ relates → observability
```

Notes:
- A node that several stacks depend on appears once; its dependents list it as a `←` prerequisite (diamonds are fine — show the prerequisite on each dependent).
- Put `relates` as `┄ relates →` lines under the node, visually distinct from the solid `←` prerequisites.

## Scope & honesty

- **Render only what is declared.** `depends-on`/`relates` are the source of truth. If the user wants runtime data-flow that the topology doesn't capture, pull it from each area's `## Interface` (inputs/outputs) — and if it isn't there either, say so rather than inventing edges.
- This skill is **read-only**. To persist the diagram as a living in-repo artifact (e.g. a generated `topology/architecture.md`), that's a separate, deliberate step the user must ask for — it needs careful placement so `llm doctor`'s pillar-orphan check doesn't flag it.
- Not to be confused with the loading-rule traversal (`expand`): that decides *what to load*; this *draws* the same declared edges.

## Patterns

| User says | You do |
|---|---|
| "Draw the architecture" / "diagrama da arquitetura" | Read `topology/index.md` → render Mermaid + ASCII to chat |
| "What's connected to `app`?" / "o que depende de `app`" | Prune to `app` + its `depends-on`/`relates`/dependents; render that slice |
| "Show apply order for prod" | Filter nodes whose `apps` include `prod` (or `all`); render the ASCII layering |
| "Which runbooks touch the data stack?" | Read `runbooks/*/index.md` `relates:`; overlay onto the diagram |
| "Put this diagram in the repo" | Explain the living-artifact follow-up (placement vs doctor); only then write it |
