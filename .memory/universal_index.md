Decided **2026-06-03** with Renato. This is the load-bearing architecture of the whole repo.

**`.llm/index.md` is byte-identical across `__base` and EVERY flavor**, sourced from `__base/index.md`. Flavors do NOT carry their own index prose. Propagation = copy the whole file `__base/index.md` → each `frameworks/<flavor>/index.md`, plus a deterministic **drift-check** (doctor / CI) that they always match. (Reuse mechanism leaning to verbatim-copy + check; build-time include was the alternative, set aside.)

**The Loading rule is the kernel — the entire project revolves around it.** Statement: *load only what is **declared**, never by filesystem proximity; loading is a **guided traversal** of the node tree — at each step the structure proposes candidates (the entries a node lists as children + the nodes in its `depends-on`/`relates`) and the LLM **prunes by relevance** to the task subject + accumulated context; recurse into surviving indexes; **terminate at a leaf** (a file with no `depends-on` and no child index).* It is **deterministic in structure** (what each node declares, where a branch ends) and **judgment-driven in selection** (which candidates are relevant). Tooling can `expand` a node (list declared candidates + subjects + index/leaf); pruning + recursion stay with the LLM.

It lives in `__base/index.md` between `<!-- BEGIN/END __base:loading-rule -->` **plain HTML-comment sentinels** — deliberately NOT an `llm:` tag, because tag bodies are adopter-owned and never overwritten on update (see [[dot-llm-update-and-doctor-design-principles]]); this must be **framework-owned prose** that `llm update` carries from source. Must stay **domain-neutral** — the framework is for ANY domain (research, design, ops, legal…), not only code.

**`depends-on` semantics changed:** from "hard MUST-load, pull the full closure" to **"strongest candidate signal, still prunable by relevance"**. `relates` = "consider". (Confirmed via Renato's described algorithm; encoded in the canonical text.)

**Flavor-specifics live in `domain.md`** (named `domain.md`, chosen by Renato 2026-06-03; the file sits at the flavor root, sibling of index.md — not in a `root/` subdir), declared as a `depends-on` of the root `index.md`. It carries: the flavor's pillars, roles, entry-point refinement (e.g. sdlc's plan `scope:` entry), and domain context. The universal entry is *role → shallow indexes + task subject*; plan-`scope:` is an sdlc refinement that lives in its `domain.md`, not in the kernel.

**Why not a symlink:** Windows fragility (admin/Dev-Mode, git core.symlinks, editor breakage) AND the adopter never receives `__base` (install copies only the chosen flavor) → a link would dangle.

**How to apply:** edit `__base/index.md` and propagate verbatim to every flavor; never put flavor-specifics in `index.md` (they go in `domain.md`); keep the loading rule domain-neutral and unchanged unless Renato approves. Add a drift-check so flavor index.md ≠ __base fails. See [[dot-llm-frameworks-layout]], [[v4_model]].
